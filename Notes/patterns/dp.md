# Dynamic Programming Pattern

## 🔹 When to Use

- Problem involves **optimal solution**
- Multiple **choices at each step**
- Overlapping subproblems

## 🔹 Key Idea

- Store results of **subproblems** to avoid recomputation

## 🔹 Steps

1. Identify **state** → what subproblem represents
2. Define **transition** → how to move from smaller to larger subproblem
3. Base cases → initialize dp table / array
4. Fill table iteratively or recursively with memoization

## 🔹 Common Uses / Examples

- House Robber
- Coin Change
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Edit Distance

## 🔹 Daily Drill Question

- LeetCode #198 House Robber
  > Identify state, transition, base case, and final answer
