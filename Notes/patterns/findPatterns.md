## How to Recognize DSA Patterns (Simple & Practical)

---

## 🎯 What is a Pattern?

A **pattern** is a common way of solving many different problems.

> Different problems, same thinking.

---

## 🧠 How Many Patterns Are There?

There are **~20 core DSA patterns** that cover **90%+** of coding interview problems.

You do NOT need more.

## 🧩 The 20 Core Patterns

### Arrays / Strings

1. Frequency Map (HashMap / Set)
2. Prefix Sum
3. Two Pointers
4. Sliding Window
5. Sorting + Scan

### Searching

6. Binary Search (Index-based)
7. Binary Search on Answer

### Stack / Queue

8. Monotonic Stack
9. Queue / Deque

### Linked List

10. Fast & Slow Pointers

### Trees / Graphs

11. DFS (Depth First Search)
12. BFS (Breadth First Search)
13. Graph Traversal (Visited Set)

### Recursion / Optimization

14. Backtracking
15. Divide & Conquer
16. Greedy
17. Dynamic Programming (1D)
18. Dynamic Programming (2D / State)

### Advanced

19. Heap / Priority Queue
20. Union Find

## 🔍 How to Recognize Patterns (Before Coding)

Ask these **5 questions** before writing code:

---

### 1️⃣ Is the data **continuous**?

Keywords:

- subarray
- substring
- consecutive

➡️ **Sliding Window**

Example:

- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

---

### 2️⃣ Is the data **sorted or monotonic**?

Or phrases like:

- minimum possible
- maximum possible
- can we do it in X?

➡️ **Binary Search**

Example:

- Koko Eating Bananas

---

### 3️⃣ Do I need to remember **past elements**?

Keywords:

- count
- frequency
- duplicates
- seen before

➡️ **HashMap / Set / Prefix Sum**

Example:

- Two Sum

---

### 4️⃣ Do I need **next / previous greater or smaller**?

Keywords:

- next greater
- previous smaller
- histogram
- temperatures

➡️ **Monotonic Stack**

Example:

- Daily Temperatures

---

### 5️⃣ Are there **choices at each step**?

Keywords:

- pick / not pick
- optimal
- minimum / maximum

➡️ **DP or Backtracking**

Example:

- House Robber
- Subsets

## 🚦 Pattern Signal Table

| Problem Signal               | Pattern        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| longest / shortest substring | Sliding Window |
| pair in sorted array         | Two Pointers   |
| repeated checks              | HashMap        |
| range sum queries            | Prefix Sum     |
| min / max possible answer    | Binary Search  |
| next greater / smaller       | Stack          |
| tree traversal               | DFS / BFS      |
| all combinations             | Backtracking   |
| optimal solution             | DP             |

## 🧪 Daily Pattern Drill (No Coding)

1. Open a random LeetCode problem
2. Do **not** code
3. Identify:
   - Input type
   - Constraints
   - Pattern
4. Close the problem

⏱️ 15 minutes per day is enough.

---

## 🔑 Golden Rules

- ❌ Don’t memorize solutions
- ✅ Memorize **patterns**
- ❌ Don’t rush to code
- ✅ Identify pattern first
- ❌ Quantity only
- ✅ Depth + revision

---

## 🏁 Final Note

> **DSA is pattern recognition, not typing speed.**

If you can identify the pattern in **under 2 minutes**,  
you are interview-ready.

⭐ Solve problems **pattern-wise**, not difficulty-wise.
