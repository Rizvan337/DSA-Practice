121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

ðŸ”— [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)


### ðŸ§  Logic

-Given an array prices[] where prices[i] is the stock price on the i-th day.

-We must buy once and sell once later, and return the maximum profit we can get.

-If we can't make any profit (prices only decrease), return 0.

-Use two approaches:

-Brute Force (O(nÂ²))

-Greedy (One-Pass) Optimal Approach (O(n))



### ðŸ’¡ Code

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force (O(nÂ²))
Try all pairs: Buy on day i and sell on day j > i, and track the maximum profit.

```js

var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let maxProfit = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
            if (prices[j] > prices[i]) {
                let profit = prices[j] - prices[i];
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxProfit;
};

####ðŸ”¹  Greedy (Optimal, One-Pass) â€“ O(n)
Track the minimum price seen so far and update the maximum profit by comparing current price and min.

var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let profit = 0
    let maxProfit = 0
    let min = Infinity
   for(let i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
    if(prices[i]<min){
        min = prices[i]
    }
    profit = prices[i]-min
    if(profit>maxProfit){
        maxProfit = profit
    }
   }
   return maxProfit
};


ðŸ’¡ Greedy Approach â€“ Intuition
We look for the lowest price to buy and then the highest price to sell after that.

Instead of checking all pairs, we just keep track of:

The lowest price so far.

The maximum profit if we sold at todayâ€™s price.

If today's price is lower than our min, we update the min.

Otherwise, we calculate the profit and update the maxProfit if itâ€™s better.

ðŸ“Š Dry Run Example
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Buy at 1 (day 1), sell at 6 (day 4) â†’ Profit = 6 - 1 = 5

âœ… Edge Cases
If the prices keep decreasing â†’ return 0
Input: [7,6,4,3,1] â†’ Output: 0

One price (not enough to buy & sell) â†’ return 0
Input: [5] â†’ Output: 0
